# Hermetic tests for the canonical scripts/family-pins.sh (Issue #210).
#
# scripts/family-pins.sh is a byte-identical copy of NEAT-AI-core's
# `scripts/family-pins.sh` (NEAT-AI-core#681) and is never edited here — these
# tests pin the contract that copy must keep for Ockham, because it is what
# rewrites the `neat-core` pin in `ockham/Cargo.toml` and it is run over the
# real manifest moments after CI fetches it:
#
#   * it reads a manifest and recognises a family git-tag pin, leaving every
#     other dependency — and a commented-out or non-family declaration — alone;
#   * a pin it cannot rewrite fails loud, naming the file and the line, rather
#     than reading as "already current";
#   * a usage error exits 2 and changes nothing.
#
# Every case is driven through `--manifest`, so no manifest carrying a real
# family pin is ever scanned: nothing here resolves a remote, runs cargo, or
# touches the network. The move itself — resolve the newest release, rewrite,
# let Cargo.lock follow — needs both, so it is covered by the CI job that
# performs it rather than faked here.
